The **“Programming Fundamentals”** course extends the previously gained basic coding skills from the <a href="https://softuni.bg/courses/programming-basics">“Programming Basics”</a> course at the Software University and adds additional **knowledge** and **practical programming skills**.
The course covers source control systems, **Git** and **GitHub** for team collaboration, understanding the basic **data types** in programming, extracting pieces of code into **methods** with parameters and return value, using the **debugger** to trace the program execution and find bugs, processing sequences of elements using **arrays** and **lists**, using **collections**, working with **matrices** for processing tabular data, working with **dictionaries** to map keys to values, using **strings** for text processing, and the basics of working with **classes** and **objects**, using API classes and defining simple classes.
Along with the programming techniques, the **algorithmic thinking** and **problem solving** skills are advanced by solving hundreds of practical programming problems. All exercises and exams are automatically evaluated with real-time feedback through the SoftUni online judge system. At the end all students take a **practical programming exam**.
